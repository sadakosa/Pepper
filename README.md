## `What is Pepper? 

Pepper is a personal assistant. She is meant to be able to cover 3 main use cases but we are only focusing on the first one for now: 
1. Scheduling 
2. Purchasing / Event Management / etc.
3. Liaising with Clients

## Scheduling 
1. Pepper is able to
    1. Understand the rhythms of the person she is assisting (e.g., what times they are ok with working and scheduling meetings, what kinds of meetings they prefer to have when) 
    2. Take instructions like schedule this guy for next week or every month and liaise with the guy directly to schedule that
        1. Connection to gmail, WhatsApp, tele, etc. required
    3. [Bonus points] Understand when something is urgent and know when to break the rules

## What we need to do to produce the scheduler
1. Have an Ollama/LLM model running
2. Connect to Google Calendar, Whatsapp, Tele, Gmail, etc. 
2a. Know the preferences of the bosses
3. Have a text interface
